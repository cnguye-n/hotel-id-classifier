THIS IS NOT READY TO BE CLONED YET!!
I need to fix the gitattributes, git ignore and all that 

You can just download Analysis Folder and paste it in your code. 

I also have a script called create_small_test_csv.py and a create_small_train_csv.py so you can create a smaller csv file
The 5k_test_set.csv and the 50K_train_set.csv was from those scripts

You can also edit the script to customize the size of the csv. For example have the train set have 100k instead of 50k
